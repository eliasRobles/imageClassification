# Description
This project it's an Image Classificator with Machine Learning.

- Initially the "dataset" is imported from the "sklearn" library, specifically it is 'mnist_784'.

- The images are presented in a set of integers that represent the pixels. Matplotlib is used to visualize them graphically.

- The "dataset" must be divided into:
    - Training set: 75% of the data.
    - Test set: 25% of the data.
 
- The algorithm must be trained, relying on the Perceptron algorithm, which is included in "sklearn".

- Finally, it shows us the images in which our algorithm failed. If you wanted to optimize the algorithm, you could give these images again as training so that the algorithm learns from its failure.
